ERROR! couldn't resolve module/action 'community.docker.docker_image'. This often indicates a misspelling, missing collection, or incorrect module path.

The error appears to be in '/etc/ansible/playbook.yml': line 10, column 7, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:

        msg: "{{ version }}"
    - name: Pull Docker image
